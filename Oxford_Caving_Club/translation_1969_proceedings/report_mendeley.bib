abstract = {A viscous extension of the well-known unsteady vortex lattice method (UVLM) is presented. First, the way the Kutta condition is applied to the UVLM is discussed. It is shown that this condition dictates the location of the collocation and control point on each panel. Then, the Kutta condition is relaxed, which introduces a singularity in the potential flow solution of the aerodynamic loads. The strength of this singularity is obtained from the triple-deck boundary layer theory and is Reynolds number dependent. The procedure of how to modify the UVLM to accommodate the new viscous condition is discussed, which alters the location of the collocation and control points on the panel. Finally, the results from the viscous UVLM are provided for three different cases, namely Wagner (step) response, Theodorsen (frequency) response, and lift history for an arbitrary nonlinear input as the airfoil motion. The over prediction of the original UVLM is addressed and a very good agreement with CFD results is observed.},

abstract = {This paper present a Non-Linear Vortex Lattice Method (NL-VLM) coupled with 2.5D RANS sectional data for aerodynamic analysis of high-lift systems. A general viscous coupling algorithm is developed for any type of lifting surfaces such as winglet or wing with important aeroelastic deflection. The coupling algorithm is also modified to include viscous sectional data computed with infinite swept wing conditions (2.5D RANS) to introduce cross flow effects. Including these effects allows better prediction of maximum lift coefficient, stagnation point and spanload over the flap. Artificial dissipation is also added to ensure a unique post-stall solution. The NL-VLM fidelity is compared against a 3D RANS flow solver on the isolated Bombardier Research Wing (BRW) in low-speed conditions with four different flap deflections. The NL-VLM produces results with fidelity comparable to 3D RANS solutions and with low computational time for complex multi-topology configurations.},

The method accounts for the effects of viscosity, and due to its low computational cost, it represents a very good tool to perform rapid and accurate wing design and optimization procedures. The mathematical model is constructed by using two-dimensional viscous analyses of the wing span-wise sections, according to strip theory, and then coupling the strip viscous forces with the forces generated by the vortex rings distributed on the wing camber surface, calculated with a fully three-dimensional vortex lifting law. The numerical results obtained with the proposed method are validated with experimental data and show good agreement in predicting both the lift and pitching moment, as well as in predicting the wing drag. The method is applied to modifying the wing of an Unmanned Aerial System to increase its aerodynamic efficiency and to calculate the drag reductions obtained by an upper surface morphing technique for an adaptable regional aircraft wing.},

Viscous coupling can be added to that classical method resulting in a Non-Linear Unsteady Vortex Lattice Method (NL-UVLM) to benefit from higher fidelity 2D computations instead of using sectional linear lift curve from thin airfoil theory. Viscous coupling is thus capable of modeling any aerodynamic effect that can be summarized into lift and drag 2D databases (e.g. sweep cross-flow (2.5D), compressibility, centrifugal-Coriolis effects, icing, aileron deflection). This article presents preliminary results generated with NL-UVLM compared with 3D Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS 3D) on a simplified S-76 test case. Coefficient of thrust shows expected behavior compared with the UVLM classical method and the figure of merit seems to have a good agreement with URANS 3D results. I.

Introduction H and smaller lifting rotor(s) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) remain unequaled for missions in confined environment such as close to cliffs, buildings or aircraft carriers because of their vertical takeoff and hovering capacities. The performances of such rotary-wing aircrafts depend largely on the accuracy, flexibility and speed of the initial design tools used in phases where many configurations can be analyzed. As of today, such optimization of the aerodynamics of these rotors' blades is dragged by the unavailability of satisfactory tools. Design is usually based on low fidelity models (Blade Element Momentum Theory) that fail to capture important features of the rotor aerodynamics such as the unsteadiness, the viscous effects, the wake development and the proximity to arbitrary obstacles. There also exists high fidelity models (CFD) but their compute and mesh generation time are too prohibitive to be affordable at early design stages. These assessments have pushed researchers to turn their attention toward so called medium fidelity methods in the context of rotary-wing: Potential Methods (Source, Doublet and Vortex). In the meantime, these potential methods have recently regained attention for fixed wing applications with the alleviation of some of the classical method's limitations by including new low computational cost non-linear coupling algorithms utilizing bidimensional higher fidelity aerodynamics computations. In this work, we present initial results toward the adaptation of a C++ Non-Linear Unsteady Vortex Lattice Method (NL-UVLM) software validated for fixed wing aerodynamics to rotary-wings aerodynamics. The addition of the non-linear coupling can enable the consideration of any bidimensional aerodynamic effect on the blade, such as profile viscosity, compressibility [1], sweep cross-flow (2.5D) [2], centrifugal-Coriolis forces [3], ice accretion [4] or control surface deflection [5] in a fast aerodynamics software.},

abstract = {Analysis of the aerodynamic effects of a propeller flowfield on bodies downstream of the propeller is a complex task. These interaction effects can have serious repercus- sions for many aspects of the vehicle, including drag changes resulting in larger power requirements, stability changes resulting in adjustments to stabilizer sizing, and lift changes requiring wing planform adjustments. Historically it has been difficult to accurately account for these effects at any stage during the design process. More recently methods using Euler solvers have been developed that capture interference effects well, although they don't provide an ideal tool for early stages of aircraft design, due to computational cost and the time and expense of setting up complex volume grids. This research proposes a method to fill the void of an interference model useful to the aircraft conceptual and preliminary designer. The proposed method combines a flexible and adaptable tool already familiar to the conceptual designer in the aerodynamic panel code, with a pseudo-steady slipstream model wherein rotational effects are discretized onto vortex particle point elements. The method maintains a freedom from volume grids that are so often necessary in the existing interference models. In addition to the lack of a volume grid, the relative computational simplicity allows the aircraft designer the freedom to rapidly test radically different configurations, including more unconventional designs like the channel wing, thereby providing a much broader design space than otherwise possible. Throughout the course of the research, verification and validation studies were conducted to ensure the most accurate model possible was being applied. Once the vortex particle scheme had been verified, and the ability to model an actuator disk with vortex particles had been validated, the overall product was compared against propeller-wing wind tunnel results conducted specifically as benchmarks for numerical methods. The method discussed in this work provides a glimpse into the possibility of pseudo-steady interference modeling using vortex particles. A great groundwork has been laid that already provides reasonable results, and many areas of interest have been discovered where future work could improve the method further. The current state of the method is demonstrated through simulations of several configurations including a wing and nacelle and a channel wing.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the aerodynamic performance and numerical modeling of over-the-wing propellers. Installing the propeller above a wing has the potential to increase wing lift-to-drag ratio, high-lift capabilities, and to reduce flyover noise. However, the prediction of its performance is difficult, since research on the aerodynamic interaction effects of over-the-wing propellers has been limited so far. For this reason, an exploratory wind tunnel campaign was performed with a wing featuring a fowler flap. A single propeller was installed above the wing at different chordwise locations and inclination angles. Wing surface-pressure and wake-pressure measurements showed strong, bilateral aerodynamic coupling between the propeller and wing. A configuration with the propeller attached to the flap showed wing lift increases of 8% and 3% in cruise and high-lift conditions, respectively. The key findings of the wind tunnel campaign were used to validate a low-fidelity numerical tool, which combines a non-uniform inflow blade-element model for the propeller, a panel method for the wing, and a vortex lattice model for the propeller slipstream. The numerical model was used to assess the effect of propeller axial location and diameter. Results indicated that the optimal axial propeller position is near the trailing edge of the wing, and that reducing the propeller diameter at constant thrust coefficient at this location is beneficial for distributed propulsion applications. The tool allows a rapid computation of over-the-wing propeller and wing performance in cruise conditions. This enables an efficient design space exploration during the conceptual design process of such configurations.},

abstract = {Stability and control derivatives are routinely used in the design and simulation of aircraft, yet other aerodynamics models exist that can provide more accurate results for certain simulations without a large increase in computational time. In this paper, several aerodynamics models of varying fidelity are coupled with a six degrees of freedom rigid body dynamics simulation tool to model various geometries under a number of different initial conditions. The aerodynamics models considered are: stability derivatives, strip theory methods, quasi-steady vortex lattice methods, and unsteady panel methods. Through dynamic simulations using a virtual wind tunnel, differences between the various aerodynamics models are examined. The simulations that were examined were primarily concerned with the short period mode in the longitudinal direction. Initial examinations were performed on single-surface geometries and showed good agreement between all models. The follow-up simulations of conventional- and canard-type aircraft configurations showed variations due primarily to the inclusion of a wake model for domain vorticity in the vortex lattice and unsteady panel methods. Although dynamics are considered, the simulations performed did not show unsteady aerodynamics effects causing significant differences in short-period responses. This suggests that the quasi-steady approaches traditionally considered are adequate for the majority of stability and control simulations. The use of unsteady panel methods is only required when reduced frequencies increase to the point where Theodorsen's lag function contributes significantly to the aerodynamic behavior. This would be the case for high frequency forced flapping flight, but is generally not the case for aircraft.},

Although he cooperated with other famous aerodynamicists like Prandtl, his contribution is not well recognized as most of his publications are in Russian. The paper discusses the role of the English, Russian and German research schools in the beginning of the Twentieth Century, and the contributions by individual researchers like Lanchester, Prandtl, Betz and Joukowsky himself. After the one-dimensional momentum theory was well established, the introduction of torque and angular momentum was the next step. Joukowsky has led the basis for this step, but Glauerts Blade Element Momentum still is the basis of current rotor design codes. He applied some assumptions limiting the validity to moderate and high tip speed ratios. S{\o}rensen and van Kuik published a solution for wind turbines with very low tip speed ratios, which is now expanded to propellers as well, with one remaining assumption of inviscid flow. For very low tip speed ratios the general momentum theory gives unphysical results which disappear after applying a perturbation parameter representing phenomena not captured by the Euler equations.},

Successful design of this new type of aircraft relies heavily on good understanding of powered lift generated through propeller-wing interactions, where the velocity distribution within propeller slipstream is critical to estimate aerodynamic forces during hover condition. The present research studied a propeller-wing combination with a plain flap. A 5-hole probe measurement system was built to construct three-dimensional (3D) velocity field at a survey plane after wing trailing edge. The study has found that significant deformation of propeller slipstream was present in the form of opposite transverse displacement on extrados and intrados. The deformation could be enhanced by flap deflections. Velocity differences caused by the slipstream deformation could imply local variation of lift distribution compared to predictions from conventional assumptions of cylindrical slipstream. An analytical method was developed to reasonably estimate the position of deformed slipstream centreline. The research underlined that the mutual aspect of propeller-wing interaction could be critical for low-speed aerodynamic design.},

Previous research has shown the benefits of particular instantiations of distributed propulsion, such as the use of wingtip-mounted cruise propellers and leading edge high-lift propellers. However, these benefits have not been reduced to a generalized design or analysis approach suitable for large-scale design exploration. This paper discusses the rapid, “design-order” toolchains developed to investigate the large, complex tradespace of candidate geometries for the X-57. Due to the lack of an appropriate, rigorous set of validation data, the results of these tools were compared to three different computational flow solvers for selected wing and propulsion geometries. The comparisons were conducted using a common input geometry, but otherwise different input grids and, when appropriate, different flow assumptions to bound the comparisons.

abstract = {A combined experimental and computational investigation of the aerodynamic interaction between propellers and wings has been conducted at the Purdue University Aerospace Sciences Laboratory. This study's primary objective was the determination of the time-averaged performance of a propeller and wing in a tractor configuration. A wind-tunnel test was performed using an untapered, semispan wing and a Purdue model propeller mounted in a tractor arrangement. All tests were conducted at low subsonic speeds, M = 0.1, and a Reynolds number of 470, 000 based on the wing chord of 8 in. A computational analysis utilizing two individual methods was performed. A semiempirical model that calculated wing performance for a predetermined steady propellerwake velocity distribution was formulated. The second method was a vortex lattice simulation of both the propeller and wing, which is capable of calculating the quasisteady loadings. The results of the experiment and the computational analysis showed good agreement and indicated a significant steady-state performance improvement for the tractor configuration, including a reduction in wing-induced drag and increases in propeller efficiency and wing lift curve slope. The quasisteady results of the computational analysis provided insight into the time-dependent loadings on both the propeller and wing. {\textcopyright} 1988 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

abstract = {Most design and analysis methods widely used for horizontal axis wind turbine performance prediction, such as the PROP code, are based on the traditional 2-D blade element/momentum theory (BEMT) methods, which are inadequate and underpredict the wind turbine rotor power output in the high-wind/peak-power condition, owing to effects of rotation on the wind turbine blade boundary layer. Although the deficiencies of the methods have been known for some time, this area has been neglected. The continued development of viable and well-established stall-regulated wind-turbine technology makes this research topic timely and particularly relevant to reducing the cost of wind energy. The main aim of the present paper is to describe and analyze the fundamental flow phenomena that characterize the boundary layer on rotating blades, and to develop a preliminary stall-delay model that modifies the 2-D airfoil data so as to simulate the 3-D stall-delay effects. The following steps were taken in the development of the model: 1) analysis of the 3-D integral boundary- layer equations for a reference system rotating with the blade, 2) description of the effects of rotor rotation on the separation point and its causes, and 3) determination of a simple correction formula to obtain rotating rotor lift coefficient Ci(a) and drag coefficient Cd(a) data from measured 2-D airfoil data. The preliminary 3-D stall-delay model consists of two key parameters (the ratio of local chord to local radius c/r the ratio of rotation speed to freestream velocity A) and three empirical correction factors(a, b, d). The stall-delay model is consistent with the blade element/momentum theory method and the Viterna/Tangler model, and the 3-D stall-delay model can be incorporated into the state of the art performance prediction codes, such as PROP. Through comparison with the field test data, the new model for 3-D stall-delay shows good agreement between predictions and experiments. The new model should be of great use in existing codes for horizontal axis wind turbine design and analysis.},

abstract = {A semi-analytical prediction method is presented to predict the effect of the propeller slipstream on the lift and pitching moment of a propeller-powered aircraft. The method assesses three effects caused by the propeller slipstream: an increase in lift over the wing due to the slipstream, a change in the tail-off pitching moment, and a change in the horizontal tail contribution to the pitching moment due to increased downwash and (possibly) dynamic pressure. This prediction method is validated using wind tunnel data for the Fokker 50 and a special version of the Saab 340 with T-tail. The prediction method shows good correlation with the experimental results for various combinations of flap deection, angle-of-attack, and thrust coefficient. Further analysis of the results demonstrates that the propeller slipstream effect reduces the tail effectiveness due to an increase in downwash gradient at the horizontal tail. Furthermore, it is shown that the effectiveness of the tail is influenced by the vertical position of the tail with respect to the slipstream due to slipstream inflow and a (possible) change dynamic pressure ratio.},

abstract = {Wingtip-mounted propellers installed in a tractor configuration can decrease the wing induced drag by attenuating the wingtip vortex by the propeller slipstream. This paper presents an aerodynamic analysis of the propeller-wing interaction effects for the wingtip-mounted propeller configuration, including a comparison with a conventional configuration with the propeller mounted on the inboard part of the wing. Measurements were taken in a low-speed wind tunnel at Delft University of Technology, with two wing models and a low-speed propeller. Particle-image-velocimetry measurements downstream of a symmetric wing with integrated flap highlighted the swirl reductions characteristic of the wingtip-mounted propeller due to wingtip-vortex attenuation and swirl recovery. External-balance and surface-pressure measurements confirmed that this led to an induced-drag reduction with inboard-up propeller rotation. In a direct comparison with a conventional propeller-wing layout, the wingtip-mounted configuration showed a drag reduction of around 15% at a lift coefficient of 0.5 and a thrust coefficient of 0.12. This aerodynamic benefit increased upon increasing the wing lift coefficient and propeller thrust setting. An analysis of the wing performance showed that the aerodynamic benefit of the wingtip-mounted propeller was due to an increase of the wing's effective span-efficiency parameter.},

abstract = {Advances in aerodynamic and propulsive efficiency of future aircraft can be achieved by strategic installation of propellers near the airframe. This paper presents a robust and computationally efficient engineering method to estimate the load distribution of a propeller operating in arbitrary nonuniform flow that is induced by the airframe and by different flight conditions. The time-resolved loading distribution is computed by determining the local blade section advance ratio and using the sensitivity distribution along the blade, which is a property of the propeller in isolated conditions. The method is applied to four representative validation cases by comparing to full-blade computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and experimental data. For the evaluated cases, it is shown that the changes in the propeller loads due to the nonuniform inflow are predicted with errors ranging from 0.5 up to 12% compared to the validation data. By extending the quasi-steady approach with a correction to account for unsteady effects, the time-resolved blade loading is also well approximated, without adding computational cost. The proposed method provided a time-resolved solution within several central processing unit seconds, which is seven orders of magnitude faster compared to full-blade CFD computations.},

abstract = {Conventional linear control allocation (LCA) methods fail to provide satisfactory per- formance in ight control systems (FCS) for aircraft with highly nonlinear and coupled control effector suites, especially for tailless aircraft with strong interactions between con- trol effectors. This is due to the inability of linear effector models to capture nonlinear and coupled control forces and moments. This paper implements an incremental nonlin- ear control allocation (INCA) approach, which can capture nonlinearities and interactions of control effectors while being solvable with simple and computationally effcient linear control allocation algorithms. This makes INCA suitable for real-time control allocation in FCS. This incremental reformulation of the control allocation problem is based on a Jacobian model of the control eFFectors, and relies on angular acceleration measurements to reduce model dependency. In addition, it operates based on real-time measurements of the actuator positions, which mitigates typical problems related to couplings between control allocators and actuator dynamics. In this paper, LCA- and INCA-based nonlinear FCS are designed for the Innovative Control Effectors (ICE) aircraft, a highly maneuver- able tailless aircraft with 13 highly nonlinear, interacting and axis-coupled control effectors. Real-time simulation results show that INCA dramatically improves tracking and control allocation performance, thus improving maneuverability and exploiting the full potential of innovative control effector suites.},

abstract = {Globalization has led to an increase in the use of small copters for different activities such as geo-referencing, agricultural fields monitoring, survillance, among others. This is the main reason why there is a strong interest in the performance of small-scale propellers used in unmanned aerial vehicles. The flow developed by rotors is complex and the estimation of its aerodynamic performance is not a trivial process. In addition, viscous effects, when the rotor operates at low Reynolds, affect its performance. In the present paper, two different computational methods, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and the Unsteady Vortex Lattice Method (UVLM) with a viscous correction, were used to study the performance of an isolated rotor of a quadcopter flying at hover. The Multi Reference Frame model and transition SST $\kappa$ − $\omega$ turbulence model were used in the CFD simulations. The tip vortex core growth was used to account for the viscous effects in the UVLM. The wake structure, pressure coefficient, thrust and torque predictions from both methods are compared. Thrust and torque results from simulations were validated by means of experimental results of a characterization of a single rotor. Finally, figure of merit of the rotor is evaluated showing that UVLM overestimates the efficiency of the rotor; meanwhile, CFD predictions are close to experimental values.},

abstract = {Propeller slipstream, or propwash, can significantly affect the aerodynamic characteristics of propeller driven aircraft by providing additional airflow over their aerodynamic and control surfaces. It is therefore essential to have a good knowledge of the induced velocity within the propeller slipstream to determine the aerodynamic forces and moments on slipstream-immersed components. Existing slipstream models based on simple momentum and lifting line theory have limited application since they consider only the acceleration of air within the slipstream and do not take into account the diffusion phenomenon. As such, they yield good results near the propeller where acceleration is dominant but fail to predict induced velocity accurately far behind the propeller where diffusion dominates. This paper presents a slipstream model that takes into account both the acceleration and diffusion phenomena via simple analytical and semi-empirical equations to predict induced velocity accurately up to $\sim$ 8 - 10 propeller diameters downstream of the propeller plane.},

abstract = {This study compares a hybrid-electric aircraft featuring a propulsive empennage and over-the-wing, distributed-propulsion to a conventional regional turboprop. The impact of multiple design parameters, mission requirements, and technology assumptions on maximum take-off mass and payload-range energy efficiency is evaluated, in order to illustrate the sensitivities of the design. A preliminary sizing method that incorporates aero-propulsive interaction effects is used to obtain rapid estimations. Results show that, for the baseline mission, the hybrid-electric variant is 2.5% heavier and consumes 2.5% more energy than the reference aircraft. In this process, several key design guidelines and challenges for distributed-propulsion aircraft are identified. Firstly, when comparing a hybrid-electric configuration to a conventional one, each aircraft must be sized at its optimum cruise altitude for the same payload and range requirements. Secondly, the hypothetical advantages of distributed propulsion described in literature do not easily lead to a benefit at aircraft level, if the aero-propulsive interaction effects and associated dependencies are incorporated in the design process. Thirdly, the power-control parameters affect practically all characteristics of the aircraft, and the optimal control strategy is highly dependent on the aero-propulsive interaction. The results suggest that the proposed configuration can constitute a low-noise alternative for the regional transport market if the performance of the over-the-wing distributed-propulsion system is optimized.},

The method is intended for use in design, modeling, and simulation. In this method, the flow separation due to stall is modeled in a vortex-lattice framework as an effective reduction in the camber, or “decambering.” For each section of the wing, a parabolic decambering flap, hinged at the separation location of the section, is calculated through iteration to ensure that the lift and moment coefficients of the section match with the values from the two-dimensional viscous input curves for the effective angle of attack of the section. As an improvement from earlier low-order methods, this method also predicts the separation pattern on the wing. Results from the method, presented for unswept wings having various airfoils, aspect ratios, taper ratios, and small, quasi-steady roll rates, are shown to agree well with experimental results in the literature, and computational solutions obtained as part of the current work.},

abstract = {A systematic procedure is presented for the analysis of the interference of a wing with multipropellers. The assumptions are made that the radius of the propeller and the chord are of the same order and both are much smaller than the span. Using the chord to span ratio as the small expansion parameter, the local two-dimensional solution for the sectional lift to angle-of-attack relationship is uncoupled from the outer three-dimensional solution in the spirit of Prandtl's lifting line theory. Details of the nonuniform stream behind the propellers enter into the local sectional analysis. For the outer solution, the planform of the wing reduces to the lifting line and the stream behind the propellers reduces to a thin sheet of a jet carrying the sectional momentum gained across the propellers and supporting a pressure difference across the sheet. By representing the thin sheet of a jet as a vortex sheet, an integral equation is obtained. When the momentum gain across the propellers is not too large, the integral equation can be further simplified. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the versatility of the analysis. {\textcopyright} 1972 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the effects of propeller installation on the aerodynamic performance of a tailplane featuring tip-mounted propellers. A model of a low aspect ratio tailplane equipped with an elevator and a tip-mounted propeller was installed in a low-speed wind-tunnel. Measurements were taken with an external balance and surface pressure taps to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of the tailplane, while the flowfield in the wake of the model was investigated using particle-image velocimetry. The experimental data are supported by CFD analyses, involving both transient simulations of the full-blade configuration and steady-state simulations the propeller replaced by an actuator-disk model. The upstream effects on the propeller time-average and time-accurate thrust and normal-forces are found to be limited for different tailplane operating conditions. It is shown that for a given propeller rotation direction, the load distribution on the tailplane is highly dependent on the direction of elevator deflection. The rotation direction of the tailplane tip-vortex relative to the propeller swirl therefore significantly affects the integral loads on the tailplane, resulting in differences in the normal-force gradient and elevator effectiveness.},

abstract = {High-lift systems have a major influence on the sizing, economics, and safety of most transport airplane configurations. The combination of complexity in flow physics, geometry, and system support and actuation has historically led to a lengthy and experiment intensive development process. However, during the recent past engineering design has changed significantly as a result of rapid developments in computational hardware and software. In aerodynamic design, computational methods are slowly superseding empirical methods and design engineers are spending more and more time applying computational tools instead of conducting physical experiments to design and analyze aircraft including their high-lift systems. The purpose of this paper is to review recent developments in aerodynamic design and analysis methods for multi-element high-lift systems on transport airplanes. Attention is also paid to the associated mechanical and cost problems since a multi-element high-lift system must be as simple and economical as possible while meeting the required aerodynamic performance levels. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {The emergence of distributed electric propulsion (DEP) concepts for aircraft systems has enabled new capabilities in the overall efficiency, capabilities, and robustness of future air vehicles. Distributed electric propulsion systems feature the novel approach of utilizing electrically-driven propulsors which are only connected electrically to energy sources or power-generating devices. As a result, propulsors can be placed, sized, and operated with greater flexibility to leverage the synergistic benefits of aero-propulsive coupling and provide improved performance over more traditional designs. A number of conventional aircraft concepts that utilize distributed electric propulsion have been developed, along with various short and vertical takeoff and landing platforms. Careful integration of electrically-driven propulsors for boundary-layer ingestion can allow for improved propulsive efficiency and wake-filling benefits. The placement and configuration of propulsors can also be used to mitigate the trailing vortex system of a lifting surface or leverage increases in dynamic pressure across blown surfaces for increased lift performance. Additionally, the thrust stream of distributed electric propulsors can be utilized to enable new capabilities in vehicle control, including reducing requirements for traditional control surfaces and increasing tolerance of the vehicle control system to engine-out or propulsor-out scenarios. If one or more turboelectric generators and multiple electric fans are used, the increased effective bypass ratio of the whole propulsion system can also enable lower community noise during takeoff and landing segments of flight and higher propulsive efficiency at all conditions. Furthermore, the small propulsors of a DEP system can be installed to leverage an acoustic shielding effect by the airframe, which can further reduce noise signatures. The rapid growth in flight-weight electrical systems and power architectures has provided new enabling technologies for future DEP concepts, which provide flexible operational capabilities far beyond those of current systems. While a number of integration challenges exist, DEP is a disruptive concept that can lead to unprecedented improvements in future aircraft designs.},

The inverse problem, the prediction of the performance of a given propeller of arbitrary form, is also treated. The theory of propellers of minimum energy loss is dependent on considerations of a regular helicoidal trailing vortex sheet; consequently, a more detailed discussion of the dynamics of vortex sheets and the consequences of their instability and roll up is presented than is usually found in treatments of propeller aerodynamics. Complete and accurate tables of the circulation function are presented. Interference effects between a fuselage or a nacelle and the propeller are considered.

The first method makes use of 2D RANS data with the quasi-steady theory to capture compressibility and viscosity effect with the UVLM. This algorithm is very flexible where multiple simulations with different motions can be executed with a single sectional database. However, the quasi-steady theory limits the method to small reduced frequency and low angles of attack. The second algorithm developed uses the full unsteady thin airfoil theory with 2D URANS data to allow the UVLM to capture non-linear unsteady effects of high reduced frequency simulation and dynamic stall. Nonetheless, the database generation is more complex and higher in terms of calculation cost. These two coupling methods are verified and compared against 2D and 3D URANS calculations.},

abstract = {A semi-analytical prediction method is presented to predict the effect of the propeller slipstream on the lift and pitching moment of a propeller-powered aircraft. The method assesses three effects caused by the propeller slipstream: an increase in lift over the wing due to the slipstream, a change in the tail-off pitching moment, and a change in the horizontal tail contribution to the pitching moment due to increased downwash and (possibly) dynamic pressure. This prediction method is validated using wind tunnel data for the Fokker 50 and a special version of the Saab 340 with T-tail. The prediction method shows good correlation with the experimental results for various combinations of flap deection, angle-of-attack, and thrust coefficient. Further analysis of the results demonstrates that the propeller slipstream effect reduces the tail effectiveness due to an increase in downwash gradient at the horizontal tail. Furthermore, it is shown that the effectiveness of the tail is influenced by the vertical position of the tail with respect to the slipstream due to slipstream inflow and a (possible) change dynamic pressure ratio.},

@article{Hasier_2019,
abstract = {The stall behavior of an empennage is a crucial and conditioning factor for its design. Thus, the preliminary design of empennages requires a fast low-order method which reliably computes the stall behavior and which must be sensitive to the design parameters (taper, sweep, dihedral, airfoil, etc.). Handbook or semi-empirical methods typically have a narrow scope and low fidelity, so a more general and unbiased method is desired. This paper presents a nonlinear vortex lattice method (VLM) for the stall prediction of generic fuselage-empennage configurations which is able to compute complete aerodynamic polars up to and beyond stall. The method is a generalized form of the van Dam algorithm, which couples the potential VLM solution with 2.5D viscous data. A novel method for computing 2.5D polars from 2D polars is presented, which extends the traditional infinite swept wing theory to finite wings, relying minimally on empirical data. The method has been compared to CFD and WTT results, showing a satisfactory degree of accuracy for the preliminary design of empennages.},

abstract = {The unsteady vortex-lattice method provides a medium-fidelity tool for the prediction of non-stationary aerodynamic loads in low-speed, but high-Reynolds-number, attached flow conditions. Despite a proven track record in applications where free-wake modelling is critical, other less-computationally expensive potential-flow models, such as the doublet-lattice method and strip theory, have long been favoured in fixed-wing aircraft aeroelasticity and flight dynamics. This paper presents how the unsteady vortex-lattice method can be implemented as an enhanced alternative to those techniques for diverse situations that arise in flexible-aircraft dynamics. A historical review of the methodology is included, with latest developments and practical applications. Different formulations of the aerodynamic equations are outlined, and they are integrated with a nonlinear beam model for the full description of the dynamics of a free-flying flexible vehicle. Nonlinear time-marching solutions capture large wing excursions and wake roll-up, and the linearisation of the equations lends itself to a seamless, monolithic state-space assembly, particularly convenient for stability analysis and flight control system design. The numerical studies emphasise scenarios where the unsteady vortex-lattice method can provide an advantage over other state-of-the-art approaches. Examples of this include unsteady aerodynamics in vehicles with coupled aeroelasticity and flight dynamics, and in lifting surfaces undergoing complex kinematics, large deformations, or in-plane motions. Geometric nonlinearities are shown to play an instrumental, and often counter-intuitive, role in the aircraft dynamics. The unsteady vortex-lattice method is unveiled as a remarkable tool that can successfully incorporate all those effects in the unsteady aerodynamics modelling. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The impingement of the propeller slipstream on a downstream surface acts as a source of structure-borne noise. The experimental study presented in this paper aims at localizing and quantifying the main sources of unsteady loading for a pylon-mounted tractorpropeller configuration. Balance measurements showed that the installation of the pylon had no significant influence on the steady-state propeller performance. Measurements of the surface-pressure fluctuations on the pylon using microphones indicated harmonic unsteady loading at integer multiples of the blade-passage frequency, caused by the periodic interaction with the propeller blade wakes and tip vortices. The average amplitude of the pressure fluctuations on the pylon surface decreased by 85% between high thrust conditions (J = 0.6) and the zero thrust condition (J ≈ 1.0). The main source of unsteady loading was the impingement of the blade tip vortices, which modified the pylon loading along the entire chord. Only at low thrust settings the impingement of the blade wakes on the leading edge of the pylon became dominant. The amplitude of the integral unsteady pylon loading showed a more complicated dependence on advance ratio, mainly due to relative phase differences between the excitations at different locations on the surface of the pylon. Increasing the propeller–pylon spacing decreased the amplitude of the unsteady pylon loading, without appreciably modifying the distribution of the pressure fluctuations over the pylon. Results show that a reduction of unsteady pylon loading can most effectively be achieved by surface treatments at the tip-vortex impingement region or with a pylon design optimized for specific operating conditions of the propeller.},

A validation study using this method to compute the flexible wing loading on a transport aircraft is presented, and the distribution compared with Wind Tunnel (WT) data. The results obtained demonstrate the applicability of this method in early stages of aircraft design.},

abstract = {The classical solution to Prandtl's well-known lifting-line theory applies only to a single lifting surface with no sweep and no dihedral. However, Prandtl's original model of a finite lifting surface has much broader applicability. A general numerical lifting-line method based on Prandtl's model is presented. Whereas classical lifting-line theory is based on applying the two-dimensional Kutta-Joukowski law to a three-dimensional flow, the present method is based on a fully three-dimensional vortex lifting law. The method can be used for systems of lifting surfaces with arbitrary camber, sweep, and dihedral. The accuracy realized from this method is shown to be comparable to that obtained from numerical panel methods and inviscid computational fluid dynamics solutions, but at a small fraction of the computational cost.},

abstract = {Recent developments in electric aircraft technology have enabled the use of distributed propulsion for the next generation of vertical lift vehicles. However, the ability to rapidly assess the performance of these design concepts, with sufficient fidelity, is a current weakness of this nascent industry. This paper explores the capacity of the viscous Vortex Particle Method (VPM) to model wake interactions found in distributed propulsion. The elements of the vortex particle method are summarized, and a new approach for the calculation of vortex stretching through the complex-step derivative approximation is presented. Preliminary validation is performed on vortex ring cases resembling the fundamental dynamics encountered in propeller wakes. Unsteady wake dynamics of individual propellers are successfully modeled, replicating the instabilities that lead to vortex breakdown as observed experimentally. Comparing the method with results from momentum theory, it is shown that VPM is consistent with theoretical values of near and far field induced velocities, and a notable feature is its ability to model near/far field transition. Furthermore, VPM is able to fully characterize induced velocities across the entire wake, from the stable region where momentum theory operates, through instability transition and eventual vortex breakdown. The simulation of a multirotor configuration of two tip-to-tip propellers is shown, displaying the capacity of VPM to model wake mixing. The results presented here are intermediate steps in the development of a mid-fidelity modeling tool for the early design stages of distributed-propulsion electric aircraft.},

@article{Hoogreef2020,
abstract = {This paper presents a synthesis of aero-propulsive interaction studies performed at Delft University of Technology, applied to conceptual aircraft designs with distributed hybrid-electric propulsion (DHEP). The studied aero-propulsive interactions include tip-mounted propulsion, wing leading-edge distributed propulsion and boundary-layer ingestion, combined with different primary propulsion-system arrangements. This paper starts with a description of the applied design framework and an overview of the aero-propulsive interactions. Subsequently, the different aircraft configurations are sized for a set of top-level requirements covering the range between regional turboprop to typical narrow-body turbofan aircraft. Results indicate that lower shaft power ratios show better performance, with the unoptimized DHEP concepts showing values of maximum take-off mass (MTOM) and payload-range energy efficiency (PREE) comparable to their reference aircraft. It was shown that beyond 20% shaft power ratio, the PREE decreases and MTOM increases much more than between 10% and 20%, indicating a possible local optimum between these values since even lower values did not yield any significant improvements. The benefits of tip-mounted propulsion are found to be constrained by the propeller blade tip Mach number in this particular analysis for the selected reference blade loading distribution. At the high range case for Mach 0.5, it can be seen that the distributed propulsion systems show the largest improvement.},

Traditional singularity-based methods used in most current comprehensive rotorcraft analysis codes are limited by the potential flow assumption and thus have to rely on empirical formulations (e.g., vortex decay factor, vortex core size, etc.) to reach a solution. This paper discusses the development and validation of a viscous vortex particle model for modeling the complicated rotor wake vorticity transportation and diffusion. Instead of solving the viscous vorticity equations through numerical discretization over the flowfield grid, the vortex particle method addresses the solution through a Lagrangian formulation in which there is no artificial numerical dissipation involved. The Lagrangian approach also allows the application of the hierarchical TreeCode and the fast multipole method. These methods can dramatically improve the computational efficiency of the viscous vortex particle simulation, which enables it to be used for practical and comprehensive rotorcraft analysis.},

abstract = {The unsteady nature of the propeller slipstream interacting with a wing has been studied by flow visualization and unsteady wing surface pressure measurements. Flow visualization was performed by marking the propeller tip vortex with smoke. Unsteady wing surface pressures were measured by traversing a wing instrumented with a chordwise array of 16 microphones in a spanwise direction through the propeller wake. This work yielded information on the motion of the propeller wake as it passes over the wing. At the wing leading edge the propeller tip vortex deformed in a spanwise direction which was attributed to an in viscid interaction. Viscous effects at the leading edge then severed the propeller tip vortex. This severed propeller tip vortex experienced significant spanwise and chordwise displacements while passing across the wing. Axial velocity in the vortex core caused the helical vortex to thicken or stretch near the wing surface. At the trailing edge the misaligned vortex filaments deformed in order to reconnect. Vortex core trajectory on the wing surface as measured from pressure contour plots was seen to vary with wing angle of attack. The magnitude of the wing surface pressure fluctuations decreased in magnitude with distance traveled along the chord. {\textcopyright} 1993 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., All rights reserved.},

Results indicate that the distribution of lift over the wing which maximizes overall efficiency differs markedly from elliptic loading. Swirl recovery by the wing leads to increments in net propeller efficiency of 6% in example cases. The maximum installed efficiency is computed for single-rotation (up-inboard and up-outboard designs) and counter-rotating systems.

abstract = {Experiments and a numerical analysis were undertaken to investigate the mutual effect between a pusher propeller and a wing/body combination. The experimental work was carried out using two different models: a half model which included fuselage, wing and pusher propeller and a two-dimensional wing with downstream propeller. Relative position between propeller and wing could be changed in both models and a total of 16 positions were analysed. Measurements included CL, CD, CM, pressure distribution, boundary layer characteristics and propeller thrust grading. The numerical analysis consists of the application of the classical propeller theory to a threedimensional panel method computer programme for the prediction of the effect of a pusher propeller on a wing/body combination, and to a two-dimensional panel method programme which includes boundary layer calculations. Results showed that the pusher propeller inflow affects the wing characteristics by changing lift, drag and pitching moment, and also can affect boundary layer transition and turbulent separation. The effect of the wing wake on the propeller showed that the low speed flow in the wake induces a fictitious increase of the propeller thrust and also increases vibration and noise. These effects are highly dependent on the relative position of wing/propeller. Both theoretical methods give good prediction of the effect of the propeller and may be used for designing a similar configuration.},

abstract = {This experimental study focuses on the aerodynamic interaction between an over-the-wing (OTW) propeller and a wing boundary layer. An OTW propeller is positioned above the hinge line of a wing with a trailing-edge flap. Measurements are carried out with and without axial pressure gradients by deflecting the flap and by extending the flat upper surface of the wing in the streamwise direction, respectively. Surface-pressure taps, microphones, and particle image velocimetry are combined to quantify both the time-averaged and unsteady interaction effects. Results show that the propeller generates an adverse pressure gradient on the wing surface that scales linearly with thrustand decreases with increasing blade-tip clearance. The pressure gradient is partially caused by slipstream contraction, which decelerates the flow near the wall. Additionally, the surface-pressure fluctuations generated beneath the propeller blades and slipstream are stronger than the time-averaged pressure increase due to flow deceleration. Consequently, the propeller triggers flow separation over the hinge line when the flap is deflected.Aparametric study of different propeller locations indicates that increasing the tip clearance is not an effective way to mitigate flow separation. However, displacing the propeller halfa radius upstream of the hinge line creates a Coandă effect, which allows the flow to remain attached. Nomenclature.},

abstract = {For aircraft that have propellers mounted in front of the wings or tail, the prop wash produced by the propellers can have a strong influence on the aerodynamics of the aircraft. As the accelerated air from the propeller flows over the wings and tail, it can cause an alteration in the aerodynamic forces produced by those surfaces. Thus, an understanding of propeller-wing interactions is essential for the design and analysis of many aircraft. There are multiple existing methods for analyzing the propeller-wing interactions. High order methods, such as wind tunnel testing or computational fluid dynamics, provide very accurate results but come at a high cost in computation or labor. Low-order methods provide results with good accuracy at a significantly lower cost. Thus, it is desirable to use low-order methods for initial design and utilize higher order methods closer to the end of the design phase. Current low-order models for propeller-wing interactions give reasonable results, but have shortcomings in either computational cost or accuracy. In an effort to improve on these existing models, an improved low-order model for propeller-wing interactions is proposed. This improved model utilizes several aerodynamic models such as blade element theory and lifting line theory as well as a novel turbulent prop wash model. The final model is shown to provide more accurate results using efficient numerical methods.},

A comparison is made to BEM to identify differences. Results are presented for yawed flow, extreme transient shear, half wake and turbulent inflow conditions. In addition to that also a dynamic pitch step case is performed including a comparison to experimental data. The aerodynamic code used for this purpose allows to easily switch between BEM and vortex line models whilst keeping the external input the same. The comparison indicates that taking into account vortex wake models can yield a significantly different aero-elastic response compared to BEM models, often acting as a damper to fluctuations. As such estimated fatigue loads are reduced for selected load cases. Since the free vortex wake simulations come at a substantial increase of CPU-time, a hybrid approach prescribing the far wake is shown to offer a promising compromise.},

In spite of their simplicity these models are very efficient and accurate. Blade-element models use the local induced velocities as an input thus they should be combined with another model in order to calculate these induced velocities. Various models are used for the calculation of the induced velocity, where the most popular ones include: momentum, simplified-momentum, lifting-line (prescribed and free wake), and vortex (McCormick and Theodorsen) models. The paper describes the various models, compares their results and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each one. The results indicate that the Blade-element/simplified-momentum model offers very good accuracy together with high efficiency. For propeller performance calculations during steady axial flight, where most of the cross-sections do not experience stall, detailed and complicated models for calculating the induced velocities do not show advantages over the simple blade-element/simplified-momentum model,.},

A closed form solution is found for an elliptic wing exactly spanning the foci of an elliptic jet.

Through numerical simulations, the influence of a wing-mounted engine nacelle on the high-lift performance of a typical twin-engine turboprop regional airliner is investigated. Compared with a clean wing situation, a wing-mounted engine nacelle reduces the maximum lift coefficient of the landing configuration by 0.24 and makes the stall characteristic steeper. The mechanism that causes such loss of performance is mainly four unfavorable effects, which coupled act on the high-lift system. Reducing the installation height of the engine nacelle can partly recover the performance loss, but also brings significant penalty for cruise efficiency. By modifying the intersection area, the lift performance of the high-lift configuration can be raised to almost the same level, but the drag performance of the cruise configuration is not substantially deteriorated.},

abstract = {Despite the complex aero-propulsive interactions inherent in propeller-driven aircraft, low-cost methods for the analysis of distributed electric propulsion (DEP) aircraft are highly desirable to enable rapid aircraft design at the conceptual level. In this paper, a computationally-inexpensive method for analyzing the effect of a wing wake on the performance of pusher propellers is demonstrated using a vortex lattice method (VLM) augmented with boundary layer corrections and coupled with a blade element model (BEM). This approach captures important features in blade loading unattainable by inviscid methods, and at computational costs far below those of high-fidelity methods. The analysis for tractor-configured aircraft uses a vortex ring model to analyze the slipstream interaction of the propellers over the wing. These aero-propulsive analyses are subsequently used to compare performance of comparable pusher-and tractor-configured aircraft. Results show increased propulsive efficiency for individual pusher propellers of up to 16.2%, depending on propeller location and thrust level. At the vehicle level, the DEP aircraft in a pusher configuration benefited from increased aero-propulsive efficiency of 5.5%. An equivalent DEP tractor configuration showed a comparable improvement of 5.3%. The simplicity of this approach allows for fast design iteration of DEP aircraft at a fraction of the cost of current high-fidelity methods.},

@article{Bramesfeld2008,
abstract = {A lifting-surface method is presented that uses elements having distributed vorticity to model lifting surfaces and their shed wakes. Using such distributed vorticity elements allows the representation of a force-free continuous wake-vortex sheet that is free of numerical singularities and is thus robust in its numerical rollup behavior. Unlike other potential-flow methods that use discrete vortex filaments having solid-core models at their centers to avoid problems with the singularities, the numerical robustness of the new method is achieved without the subsequent solution being dependent on the choice of a cutoff distance or core size. The computed loads compare well with results of classical theory and other potential-flow methods. Its numerical robustness, computational speed, and ability to predict loads accurately make the new method ideal for the investigation of applications in which the loadings on a lifting surface depend strongly on the influence of the wake and its shape, as is the case for the two application examples presented: formation flight and rotating-wing systems.

abstract = {In this paper we describe the technical analysis capabilities necessary to perform con-ceptual design studies of small aircraft concepts that employ distributed propeller electric propulsion systems. These new aircraft concepts may achieve higher aerodynamic effciency than conventional designs through the synergistic interaction between propellers and the wing. Consequentially, one of the most crucial components of the analysis is an aerodynamic model capable of analyzing the propellers' influence on the wing and the wing's influence on the propellers. We have implemented a vortex lattice model capable of capturing this mutual influence and reduced the computational run time of the model by employing graphics processing units. This aerodynamic analysis will form the basis of a multidisciplinary design, analysis, and optimization framework that will be used to perform conceptual design studies of these configurations.},

@article{Cole2019,
abstract = {A higher-order free-wake (HOFW) method has been developed to enable conceptual design-space explorations of propeller-wing systems. The method uses higher-order vorticity elements to represent the wings and propeller blades as lifting surfaces. The higher-order elements allow for improved force resolution and more intrinsically computationally stable wakes than a comparable vortex-lattice method, while retaining the relative ease of geometric representation inherent to such methods. The propeller and wing surfaces and wakes are modeled within the same flowfield, thus accounting for mutual interaction without the need for empirical models. Time-averaged results found using the HOFW method are compared with experimental propeller, proprotor, and propeller-wing system data, along with two semi-empirical methods. The results show that the method is well suited for performance prediction of lightly loaded propellers/proprotors and propeller-wing systems and can successfully predict design trends. In addition, the time required to define a geometry and solve for the flowfield with the HOFW method as compared to that required with a computational fluid dynamics method make it particularly useful for design-space exploration. These strengths were highlighted through a sample design study on a generic distributed propulsion vehicle.},

The resulting calculations of this reciprocal aerodynamic influence of the propeller and the wing have exhibited and confirmed quasisteady typical variation. The hybrid numerical scheme applied to isolated wing and propeller, in quasisteady flow conditions, as well as coupled configurations, show that the close vortex wing surface interaction gives rise to a low pressure peak on the wing upper surface, which produces an increase in the positive local lift area near the trailing edge.},

@article{Marretta1997,
abstract = {A high-portability numerical technique based on the method of free wake analysis (FWA) is described that analyzes the interference between an aircraft propeller and a wing having different planforms and computes the influence of the wing aerodynamic field on the propeller performance. For an isolated propeller and wing, the models employed are based on the FWA and Prandtl theory, respectively. The performance of the propeller in the presence of the wing is related to the wing angle of attack and to the variation of wing circulation and the corresponding induced velocity at the propeller disk. A numerical model, previously and successfully used, was implemented to account for the effects of a wing on the wing-propeller coupling. To test the robustness of the method, the available experimental data obtained on a scale model of an isolated propeller are used. In a correlation study, the results, when wing and propeller are coupled, show the sensitivity of thrust, power, and efficiency to inflow conditions and blade pitch, as well as to the wing planform.},

@article{Stone2008,
abstract = {This paper considers the aerodynamic modeling of a twin-engine tail-sitter unmanned air vehicle that relies on wing- and fin-mounted control surfaces submerged in the propeller slipstreams for control during low-speed vertical flight. The aerodynamic forces on this vehicle are predicted using a full azimuthal blade-element solution for the propellers combined with a fixed-wake panel-method model of the vehicle itself. When the flow components determined from the propeller solution are superimposed on the external flowfield and integrated with the panelmethod model, the aerodynamic forces can be determined for the full vehicle, including slipstream effects, which are dominant in low-speed flight. The modeling described in this paper has been used extensively for multidisciplinary optimization work, as well as in the construction of a comprehensive aerodynamic database for the vehicle. This database encompasses all the aerodynamic force and moment coefficients and their derivatives for over 4300 separate flight conditions and has been extensively used for vehicle simulation and control design purposes.
