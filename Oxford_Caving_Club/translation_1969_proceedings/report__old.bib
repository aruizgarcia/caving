@article{mulder_path_reconstruction,
abstract = {Aircraft parameter identification techniques have become accepted as indispensable tools in the evaluation of prototype- and derivative aircraft in flight. Applications include estimation of stability- and control derivatives in the linearized equations of motion, synthesis of nonlinear aerodynamic and propulsion models in the context of performance certification and incorporation of information from dynamic flight test manoeuvres in a priori nonlinear flight simulation models. A variety of techniques in the time- as well as the frequency domain have been applied in tile past. One of the successful techniques is the so-called two-step method (TSM) in which the original state-parameter estimation problem is decomposed into a nonlinear state/parameter estimation or reconstruction problem and a subsequent linear parameter identification problem. In the literature, the first step of the TSM is often referred to as `flight path reconstruction'. The present paper focuses on the first step of the TSM. After a derivation of the system models describing the flight path relative to a flat earth as well as a spherical and rotating earth, and observation models for air data and GPS, the flight path reconstruction problem is introduced. Requirements with respect to type and quality of flight test transducers are discussed. Next follows an overview of different approaches to the solution of the flight path reconstruction problem with emphasis on Kalman filter/smoother and Maximum Likelihood methods. A new adaptive algorithm is presented, the Modified Recursive Maximum Likelihood Adaptive Filter (MRML) which is shown to be significantly more robust with respect to initialization errors than earlier methods. A reconstructibility analysis is presented for different transducer combinations. Numerical examples are presented based on simulated as well as actual flight test data. Flight results are given of the flight path reconstruction part of an on-line pseudo real-time application of the TSM. The paper ends with concluding remarks.},

abstract = {Acute administration of adrenomedullin (AM) exerts beneficial hemodynamic, renal, and neurohormonal effects in heart failure (HF). However, chronic effects of AM administration on HF remain unknown. This study sought to examine the effect of chronic infusion of AM on progression of HF in rat. Human recombinant AM was administered by osmotic minipump for 7 weeks in the HF model of Dahl salt-sensitive rats. The effect was compared with vehicle and diuretic treatment group. Chronic AM infusion significantly decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, right ventricular systolic pressure, right atrial pressure, and left ventricular weight/body weight (P{\textless}0.01 for all). AM significantly attenuated the increase in circulating renin-aldosterone, endogenous rat AM, and atrial natriuretic peptide levels (P{\textless}0.01 for all). AM also inhibited the myocardial tissue levels of angiotensin II and atrial and brain natriuretic peptide (P{\textless}0.01 for all). These changes were associated with the improvement of cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance (both P{\textless}0.05). Furthermore, AM improved left ventricular end-systolic elastance (P{\textless}0.01). These improvements were greater in the AM than in the diuretic group, although both drugs similarly decreased systolic blood pressure and increased urinary sodium excretion. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that AM significantly prolonged survival time compared with diuretic (P{\textless}0.05) and vehicle (P{\textless}0.01) treatment groups. These results suggest that endogenous AM plays a compensatory role in HF and that chronic AM infusion attenuates progression of left ventricular dysfunction and improves survival, at least in part, through inhibition of circulating and myocardial neurohormonal activation.},

@conference{vos_fuselage,
abstract = {This paper outlines a new concept for a pressure cabin design for blended-wing-body aircraft. An overview is presented of the wide oval cabin and why it is believed to be a possible alternative to existing designs of non-circular pressurized cabins. The perimeter of the oval cross section is formed by four smoothly connecting arcs of different radii. One arc forms the upper surface of the fuselage, one arc forms the lower surface, and two arcs at either side form the side of the fuselage. At the interconnection nodes of each of the arcs a prismatic box structure caries the tension and compression loads that result from pressurization. This structural layout forms a large uninterrupted internal space that allows for a flexible cabin configuration. Furthermore, this concept encompasses synergy in aerodynamic and structural design by having the lower member of the prismatic box structure forming the passenger floor and having the cabin outer skin panels be directly part of the aerodynamic shell. A method has been developed that estimates the weight of the cabin based on pressurization loads and main geometrical parameters of the cabin (height, span distribution, and length) as well as the geometry of the airfoil in the plane of symmetry of the cabin. A cabin design for 400 passengers shows a total cabin weight of 34 metric tons, and sufficient cargo volume for 36 LD3 containers.},

abstract = {A short theoretical study of aircraft aerodynamic model equations with unsteady effects is presented. The aerodynamic forces and moments are expressed in terms of indicial functions or internal state variables. The first representation leads to aircraft integro-differential equations of motion; the second preserves the state-space form of the model equations. The formulations of unsteady aerodynamics is applied in two examples. The first example deals with a one-degree-of-freedom harmonic motion about one of the aircraft body axes. In the second example, the equations for longitudinal short-period motion are developed. In these examples, only linear aerodynamic terms are considered. The indicial functions are postulated as simple exponentials and the internal state variables are governed by linear, time-invariant, first-order differential equations. It is shown that both approaches to the modeling of unsteady aerodynamics lead to identical models.},

abstract = {Experimental data for scale-model aircraft are used to define the aerodynamic characteristics of full-scale aircraft, verify theoretically predicted aerodynamic characteristics, and provide data where theory is deficient. To apply the data to a full-scale aircraft or its components with maximum validity, certain similitude conditions must be met. The similitude of the geometric configurations is a fundamental requirement, as is the similitude of the angles of attack. Reynolds number and Froude number, as well as Mach number in the case of compressible flow conditions, are pertinent parameters for steady-state (static) or dynamic test conditions. A number of other similitude parameters may be important, depending on the test obj ectives and aircraft elasticity .},

@conference{benad,
abstract = {In this work an idea on how to efficiently use the volume inside a pure flying wing for commercial passenger transport was derived and a configuration proposal was made with this idea. This configuration was then compared with a reference aircraft. The idea is to arrange two cylindrical pressurized sections for the payload swept back in the shape of a V and place them inside the front section of a wing with the same sweep angle. The streamwise cut through the oblique pressurized section is flat and elliptical and thus, it fits efficiently into conventional airfoils. The cut of the pressurized section orthogonal to the leading edge however, is circular. This leads to an efficient structural solution as pressure can be preserved well in a cylindrical shape. The proposed configuration is called the Flying V. For this configuration transition and outer wings extend the span of the highly swept middle wing at a lower sweep angle to 65m. The Flying V was designed in this work with a capacity of 315 passengers in a two class layout for a cruise speed of Ma=0.85. The Airbus A350-900 has the same capacity and cruise speed and was chosen as a reference aircraft. Preliminary estimations made in this work indicate that the Flying V might have a benefit over the reference in terms of aerodynamics (10{\%} higher L/D) and mass (2{\%} lower empty weight). More qualitative arguments in favor of the Flying V which could be derived are the compactness and simplicity of the configuration (less parts, no high-lift devices, no fairings, straight lines) and the shielding of the engines from the ground (low noise). Remarkable is also the elliptical lift distribution of the naturally stable design using only a moderate wing twist and no reflexed camber lines. A radio controlled model of the Flying V was presented in this work to demonstrate these aerodynamic characteristics and support the estimations and simulations which were made.},

abstract = {Means of assessing the accuracy of maximum likelihood parameter estimates obtained from dynamic flight data are discussed. The most commonly used analytical predictors of accuracy are derived and compared from both statistical and simplified geometrics standpoints. The accuracy predictions are evaluated with real and simulated data, with an emphasis on practical considerations, such as modeling error. Improved computations of the Cramer-Rao bound to correct large discrepancies due to colored noise and modeling error are presented. The corrected Cramer-Rao bound is shown to be the best available analytical predictor of accuracy, and several practical examples of the use of the Cramer-Rao bound are given. Engineering judgement, aided by such analytical tools, is the final arbiter of accuracy estimation.},
