abstract = {In the current work a methodology to quickly estimate propeller slipstream effects on a finite wing, for early design stage, is developed. The aerodynamic model consists of a Truckenbrodt 3D lifting surface method, coupled with an airfoil numerical solver for taking into account viscosity and camber effects, and a blade element theory for the formulation of the propeller aerodynamics. Results of the proposed method are validated against RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes) data for a conventional four-propeller transport aircraft and a novel Contra-Rotating Open Rotor (CROR) aircraft. A good agreement with the high fidelity solutions is obtained. The low computational cost makes the method attractive and suitable for performing extensive studies such as Multi-Disciplinary Optimisation (MDO) or to explore several alternative designs during the conceptual and preliminary design phases.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the aerodynamic performance and numerical modeling of over-the-wing propellers. Installing the propeller above a wing has the potential to increase wing lift-to-drag ratio, high-lift capabilities, and to reduce flyover noise. However, the prediction of its performance is difficult, since research on the aerodynamic interaction effects of over-the-wing propellers has been limited so far. For this reason, an exploratory wind tunnel campaign was performed with a wing featuring a fowler flap. A single propeller was installed above the wing at different chordwise locations and inclination angles. Wing surface-pressure and wake-pressure measurements showed strong, bilateral aerodynamic coupling between the propeller and wing. A configuration with the propeller attached to the flap showed wing lift increases of 8% and 3% in cruise and high-lift conditions, respectively. The key findings of the wind tunnel campaign were used to validate a low-fidelity numerical tool, which combines a non-uniform inflow blade-element model for the propeller, a panel method for the wing, and a vortex lattice model for the propeller slipstream. The numerical model was used to assess the effect of propeller axial location and diameter. Results indicated that the optimal axial propeller position is near the trailing edge of the wing, and that reducing the propeller diameter at constant thrust coefficient at this location is beneficial for distributed propulsion applications. The tool allows a rapid computation of over-the-wing propeller and wing performance in cruise conditions. This enables an efficient design space exploration during the conceptual design process of such configurations.},

abstract = {Analysis of the aerodynamic effects of a propeller flowfield on bodies downstream of the propeller is a complex task. These interaction effects can have serious repercus- sions for many aspects of the vehicle, including drag changes resulting in larger power requirements, stability changes resulting in adjustments to stabilizer sizing, and lift changes requiring wing planform adjustments. Historically it has been difficult to accurately account for these effects at any stage during the design process. More recently methods using Euler solvers have been developed that capture interference effects well, although they don't provide an ideal tool for early stages of aircraft design, due to computational cost and the time and expense of setting up complex volume grids. This research proposes a method to fill the void of an interference model useful to the aircraft conceptual and preliminary designer. The proposed method combines a flexible and adaptable tool already familiar to the conceptual designer in the aerodynamic panel code, with a pseudo-steady slipstream model wherein rotational effects are discretized onto vortex particle point elements. The method maintains a freedom from volume grids that are so often necessary in the existing interference models. In addition to the lack of a volume grid, the relative computational simplicity allows the aircraft designer the freedom to rapidly test radically different configurations, including more unconventional designs like the channel wing, thereby providing a much broader design space than otherwise possible. Throughout the course of the research, verification and validation studies were conducted to ensure the most accurate model possible was being applied. Once the vortex particle scheme had been verified, and the ability to model an actuator disk with vortex particles had been validated, the overall product was compared against propeller-wing wind tunnel results conducted specifically as benchmarks for numerical methods. The method discussed in this work provides a glimpse into the possibility of pseudo-steady interference modeling using vortex particles. A great groundwork has been laid that already provides reasonable results, and many areas of interest have been discovered where future work could improve the method further. The current state of the method is demonstrated through simulations of several configurations including a wing and nacelle and a channel wing.},

abstract = {Conventional linear control allocation (LCA) methods fail to provide satisfactory per- formance in ight control systems (FCS) for aircraft with highly nonlinear and coupled control effector suites, especially for tailless aircraft with strong interactions between con- trol effectors. This is due to the inability of linear effector models to capture nonlinear and coupled control forces and moments. This paper implements an incremental nonlin- ear control allocation (INCA) approach, which can capture nonlinearities and interactions of control effectors while being solvable with simple and computationally effcient linear control allocation algorithms. This makes INCA suitable for real-time control allocation in FCS. This incremental reformulation of the control allocation problem is based on a Jacobian model of the control eFFectors, and relies on angular acceleration measurements to reduce model dependency. In addition, it operates based on real-time measurements of the actuator positions, which mitigates typical problems related to couplings between control allocators and actuator dynamics. In this paper, LCA- and INCA-based nonlinear FCS are designed for the Innovative Control Effectors (ICE) aircraft, a highly maneuver- able tailless aircraft with 13 highly nonlinear, interacting and axis-coupled control effectors. Real-time simulation results show that INCA dramatically improves tracking and control allocation performance, thus improving maneuverability and exploiting the full potential of innovative control effector suites.},

abstract = {Wingtip-mounted propellers installed in a tractor configuration can decrease the wing induced drag by attenuating the wingtip vortex by the propeller slipstream. This paper presents an aerodynamic analysis of the propeller-wing interaction effects for the wingtip-mounted propeller configuration, including a comparison with a conventional configuration with the propeller mounted on the inboard part of the wing. Measurements were taken in a low-speed wind tunnel at Delft University of Technology, with two wing models and a low-speed propeller. Particle-image-velocimetry measurements downstream of a symmetric wing with integrated flap highlighted the swirl reductions characteristic of the wingtip-mounted propeller due to wingtip-vortex attenuation and swirl recovery. External-balance and surface-pressure measurements confirmed that this led to an induced-drag reduction with inboard-up propeller rotation. In a direct comparison with a conventional propeller-wing layout, the wingtip-mounted configuration showed a drag reduction of around 15% at a lift coefficient of 0.5 and a thrust coefficient of 0.12. This aerodynamic benefit increased upon increasing the wing lift coefficient and propeller thrust setting. An analysis of the wing performance showed that the aerodynamic benefit of the wingtip-mounted propeller was due to an increase of the wing's effective span-efficiency parameter.},

abstract = {The emergence of distributed electric propulsion (DEP) concepts for aircraft systems has enabled new capabilities in the overall efficiency, capabilities, and robustness of future air vehicles. Distributed electric propulsion systems feature the novel approach of utilizing electrically-driven propulsors which are only connected electrically to energy sources or power-generating devices. As a result, propulsors can be placed, sized, and operated with greater flexibility to leverage the synergistic benefits of aero-propulsive coupling and provide improved performance over more traditional designs. A number of conventional aircraft concepts that utilize distributed electric propulsion have been developed, along with various short and vertical takeoff and landing platforms. Careful integration of electrically-driven propulsors for boundary-layer ingestion can allow for improved propulsive efficiency and wake-filling benefits. The placement and configuration of propulsors can also be used to mitigate the trailing vortex system of a lifting surface or leverage increases in dynamic pressure across blown surfaces for increased lift performance. Additionally, the thrust stream of distributed electric propulsors can be utilized to enable new capabilities in vehicle control, including reducing requirements for traditional control surfaces and increasing tolerance of the vehicle control system to engine-out or propulsor-out scenarios. If one or more turboelectric generators and multiple electric fans are used, the increased effective bypass ratio of the whole propulsion system can also enable lower community noise during takeoff and landing segments of flight and higher propulsive efficiency at all conditions. Furthermore, the small propulsors of a DEP system can be installed to leverage an acoustic shielding effect by the airframe, which can further reduce noise signatures. The rapid growth in flight-weight electrical systems and power architectures has provided new enabling technologies for future DEP concepts, which provide flexible operational capabilities far beyond those of current systems. While a number of integration challenges exist, DEP is a disruptive concept that can lead to unprecedented improvements in future aircraft designs.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the effects of propeller installation on the aerodynamic performance of a tailplane featuring tip-mounted propellers. A model of a low aspect ratio tailplane equipped with an elevator and a tip-mounted propeller was installed in a low-speed wind-tunnel. Measurements were taken with an external balance and surface pressure taps to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of the tailplane, while the flowfield in the wake of the model was investigated using particle-image velocimetry. The experimental data are supported by CFD analyses, involving both transient simulations of the full-blade configuration and steady-state simulations the propeller replaced by an actuator-disk model. The upstream effects on the propeller time-average and time-accurate thrust and normal-forces are found to be limited for different tailplane operating conditions. It is shown that for a given propeller rotation direction, the load distribution on the tailplane is highly dependent on the direction of elevator deflection. The rotation direction of the tailplane tip-vortex relative to the propeller swirl therefore significantly affects the integral loads on the tailplane, resulting in differences in the normal-force gradient and elevator effectiveness.},

The studied aero-propulsive interactions include tip-mounted propulsion, wing leading-edge distributed propulsion and boundary-layer ingestion, combined with different primary propulsion-system arrangements. This paper starts with a description of the applied design framework and an overview of the aero-propulsive interactions. Subsequently, the different aircraft configurations are sized for a set of top-level requirements covering the range between regional turboprop to typical narrow-body turbofan aircraft. Results indicate that lower shaft power ratios show better performance, with the unoptimized DHEP concepts showing values of maximum take-off mass (MTOM) and payload-range energy efficiency (PREE) comparable to their reference aircraft. It was shown that beyond 20% shaft power ratio, the PREE decreases and MTOM increases much more than between 10% and 20%, indicating a possible local optimum between these values since even lower values did not yield any significant improvements. The benefits of tip-mounted propulsion are found to be constrained by the propeller blade tip Mach number in this particular analysis for the selected reference blade loading distribution. At the high range case for Mach 0.5, it can be seen that the distributed propulsion systems show the largest improvement.},

abstract = {A systematic procedure is presented for the analysis of the interference of a wing with multipropellers. The assumptions are made that the radius of the propeller and the chord are of the same order and both are much smaller than the span. Using the chord to span ratio as the small expansion parameter, the local two-dimensional solution for the sectional lift to angle-of-attack relationship is uncoupled from the outer three-dimensional solution in the spirit of Prandtl's lifting line theory. Details of the nonuniform stream behind the propellers enter into the local sectional analysis. For the outer solution, the planform of the wing reduces to the lifting line and the stream behind the propellers reduces to a thin sheet of a jet carrying the sectional momentum gained across the propellers and supporting a pressure difference across the sheet. By representing the thin sheet of a jet as a vortex sheet, an integral equation is obtained. When the momentum gain across the propellers is not too large, the integral equation can be further simplified. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the versatility of the analysis. {\textcopyright} 1972 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recent developments in electric aircraft technology have enabled the use of distributed propulsion for the next generation of vertical lift vehicles. However, the ability to rapidly assess the performance of these design concepts, with sufficient fidelity, is a current weakness of this nascent industry. This paper explores the capacity of the viscous Vortex Particle Method (VPM) to model wake interactions found in distributed propulsion. The elements of the vortex particle method are summarized, and a new approach for the calculation of vortex stretching through the complex-step derivative approximation is presented. Preliminary validation is performed on vortex ring cases resembling the fundamental dynamics encountered in propeller wakes. Unsteady wake dynamics of individual propellers are successfully modeled, replicating the instabilities that lead to vortex breakdown as observed experimentally. Comparing the method with results from momentum theory, it is shown that VPM is consistent with theoretical values of near and far field induced velocities, and a notable feature is its ability to model near/far field transition. Furthermore, VPM is able to fully characterize induced velocities across the entire wake, from the stable region where momentum theory operates, through instability transition and eventual vortex breakdown. The simulation of a multirotor configuration of two tip-to-tip propellers is shown, displaying the capacity of VPM to model wake mixing. The results presented here are intermediate steps in the development of a mid-fidelity modeling tool for the early design stages of distributed-propulsion electric aircraft.},

The impact of multiple design parameters, mission requirements, and technology assumptions on maximum take-off mass and payload-range energy efficiency is evaluated, in order to illustrate the sensitivities of the design. A preliminary sizing method that incorporates aero-propulsive interaction effects is used to obtain rapid estimations. Results show that, for the baseline mission, the hybrid-electric variant is 2.5% heavier and consumes 2.5% more energy than the reference aircraft. In this process, several key design guidelines and challenges for distributed-propulsion aircraft are identified. Firstly, when comparing a hybrid-electric configuration to a conventional one, each aircraft must be sized at its optimum cruise altitude for the same payload and range requirements. Secondly, the hypothetical advantages of distributed propulsion described in literature do not easily lead to a benefit at aircraft level, if the aero-propulsive interaction effects and associated dependencies are incorporated in the design process. Thirdly, the power-control parameters affect practically all characteristics of the aircraft, and the optimal control strategy is highly dependent on the aero-propulsive interaction. The results suggest that the proposed configuration can constitute a low-noise alternative for the regional transport market if the performance of the over-the-wing distributed-propulsion system is optimized.},

abstract = {A semi-analytical prediction method is presented to predict the effect of the propeller slipstream on the lift and pitching moment of a propeller-powered aircraft. The method assesses three effects caused by the propeller slipstream: an increase in lift over the wing due to the slipstream, a change in the tail-off pitching moment, and a change in the horizontal tail contribution to the pitching moment due to increased downwash and (possibly) dynamic pressure. This prediction method is validated using wind tunnel data for the Fokker 50 and a special version of the Saab 340 with T-tail. The prediction method shows good correlation with the experimental results for various combinations of flap deection, angle-of-attack, and thrust coefficient. Further analysis of the results demonstrates that the propeller slipstream effect reduces the tail effectiveness due to an increase in downwash gradient at the horizontal tail. Furthermore, it is shown that the effectiveness of the tail is influenced by the vertical position of the tail with respect to the slipstream due to slipstream inflow and a (possible) change dynamic pressure ratio.},

@article{Agostinelli2015,
abstract = {In this paper rapid aerodynamic modelling and design tools are developed and validated, in particular to model the effects of propeller slipstream. A numerical method to take into account the effects of wing mounted propeller on aerodynamic performance is validated against RANS - Actuator Disk model. Combining a power off (no propeller effects) RANS database, created setting the wing at a number of ight incidences, with a Blade Element Momentum theory module, the method allows variation of parameters such as propeller span and vertical position. A novel method of modelling the physics due to vertical shift of the propeller is also presented. This combines existing slipstream tube contraction models with a geometric transformation of the tangential induced velocity. Following a validation with the in ow angle and the vertical shift of the propeller, an optimisation study of the placement of the actuator disk has been performed. Results have been validated against Actuator Disk simulations, and cost issues considered.},

@article{NguyenVan2020,
abstract = {A sequential co-design framework has been developed in a previous study (Nguyen-Van et al., IFAC-PapersOnLine 52(12):514–519, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2019.11.295, 2019)) to design an aircraft using active differential thrust. Differential thrust is used instead of a rudder to generate the yawing moment. The objective is to dimension in parallel the vertical tail surface area, the electric motor bandwidth and control laws while maintaining imposed handling qualities. This paper focuses on the development of a single step co-design taking into account handling qualities, flight envelop requirements and motor saturation. Additional and compatible optimisation constraints are found based on a sensitivity analysis. It reveals the importance of electric motor bandwidth with respect to aircraft natural stability. The direct co-design leads to an optimised trade-off between vertical tail and electric motor bandwidth.},
